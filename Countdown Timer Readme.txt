First we created 3 files of html css and javascript
Then in css added box sizing to all document.added font from google fonts named as poppins.
but before that we have to add css to html by link rel stylesheet and javascript by script src.
after that add font poppins for body.Margin 0 for box sizing.
then we added background image in css and min height 100vh(vh is viewport height.)
then we added background size as cover so it fills the entire page even by stretching the image.
then we added background position to centre centre  so it centres the image.
after that we switch to html where we add h1 in body as new years eve.
after that in html we need to create ids for days hours minutes and seconds.
